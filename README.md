Each page has its own CSS file. The styles that are common to all pages are located in the main-styles.css file. Navigation between pages is done via the menu at the top of the page <nav> or via links in the <footer> element. Photos, icons and fonts are located in the assets folder. Media queries are located on the bottom of each file.
