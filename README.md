Repository for semester project.
Each page has its own CSS file. The styles that are common to all pages are located in the main-styles.css file. Navigation between pages is done via the menu at the top of the page <nav> or via links in the <footer> element. Photos, icons and fonts are located in the assets folder. Media queries are located on the bottom of each file.

****\*\*\***** On the main page in the Exhibition Spaces section, I used a carousel that does not work as planned. Therefore, only the element with class "static" is visible instead. To unlock the carousel display and see the effects of my work, you need to unlock the code in lines 284-290 and 185-187 in the CSS code in the homepage-styles.css file. I think the problem is a small detail that I can't grasp, so I'd be grateful for some pointers.**\*\***
