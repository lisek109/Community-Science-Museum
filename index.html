              Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're commited
              to making science accessible to all.

            <p class="middle-p">
              Overthe course of human history,science has developed from our
              early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
              everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
              life itself.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
              experience the wonders of our discoveries and peehaps even ignite
              a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around
              us.We believe science not be confined to the textbook, but brought
              to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
              exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many
              of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play
              around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
              exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone's gone
              home)

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

            <p>
              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
              longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
              growth of our understanding of medicine.

              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, “The

              about the universe around us. We'll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
              the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.

              applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

          <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lightning,
            to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
